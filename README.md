# rb1-retinal-organoids-rnaseq
Reproducing and validating the differential expression analysis performed on retinal organoids differentiated from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) carrying mutations in the **RB1** gene.    The original dataset comes from the [Expression Atlas](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/experiments/E-MTAB-10331/Results) (accession: **E-MTAB-10331**).

## Methods
The analysis workflow is inspired by publicly available RNA-seq tutorials, such as  
["Differential Expression Analysis with DESeq2" by StatQuest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGbZmlGLG5w).
